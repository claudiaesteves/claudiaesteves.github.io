I received a M.Sc. degree in Informatics from the [Universit√© Toulouse III](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) and a Ph.D. degree in Robotics from the [INP-T](https://www.inp-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html), at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr) in Toulouse, France in 2003 and 2007, respectively. During my Ph.D. I worked on algorithms for the generation of antropomorphic movements with the [Gepetto Research Team](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/gepetto) under the supervision of [Dr. Jean-Paul Laumond](https://www.laas.fr/~jpl). I have been a research faculty member at the Department of Mathematics ([DEMAT-UG](http://www.demat.ugto.mx/)) of the Universidad de Guanajuato since 2007. My research interests are in the fields of Computer Graphics, Robotics and Visualization, particularty in applications to the analysis and automatic synthesis of human motion.
