<h3>About Me</h3>

Hi, my name is Claudia Esteves and I am a full-time professor at the Department of Mathematics ([DEMAT-UG](http://www.demat.ugto.mx/)) of the Universidad de Guanajuato in Guanajuato, Gto., México. I received a M.Sc. in Informatics from the [Université Toulouse III](https://www.univ-tlse3.fr/) and a Ph.D. in Robotics from the [INP-T](https://www.inp-toulouse.fr/fr/index.html), at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr) in Toulouse, France in 2003 and 2007, respectively. During my Ph.D. I worked on algorithms for the generation of antropomorphic movements with the [Gepetto Research Team](https://www.laas.fr/public/en/gepetto) under the supervision of [Dr. Jean-Paul Laumond](https://www.laas.fr/~jpl). My research interests are in the fields of Computer Graphics, Robotics and Visualization, particularty in applications to the analysis and automatic synthesis of human motion. I teach on the undegraduate programs in Mathematics and Computational Mathematics of DEMAT and on the graduate programs of [CIMAT](http://www.cimat.mx).
